# Hi, I'm Uno!

Coincidentially, I also enjoy a similarly named card game. 

I make things sometimes. I enjoy application reverse engineering and low-level programming (C++, Assembly) but will also make other things, including web stuff (like [GE-Z](https://github.com/laurelin60/GE-Z-Backend) for cheap, easy ONLINE ASYNC CC classes that clear your GE requirements). 

I mostly do stuff in an [organization](https://github.com/laurelin60/) I made with some friends.

## Hackathons 

I like going to hackathons for fun (also there's free food). Here's my Devpost:
