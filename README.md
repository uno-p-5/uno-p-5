### Hi, I'm Uno!

Coincidentially, I also enjoy a similarly named card game. 

I make stuff sometimes. I enjoy application reverse engineering but will also make web stuff (like [GE-Z](https://github.com/laurelin60/GE-Z-Backend) for cheap, easy ONLINE ASYNC CC classes that clear your GE requirements). 

I mostly do stuff in an [organization](https://github.com/laurelin60/) I made with some friends.
