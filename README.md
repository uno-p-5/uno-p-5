### Hi, I'm Uno!

Coincidentially, I also enjoy a similarly named card game. 

I make things sometimes. I enjoy application reverse engineering and low-level programming (C++, Assembly) but will also make other things, including web stuff (like [GE-Z](https://github.com/laurelin60/GE-Z-Backend) for cheap, easy ONLINE ASYNC CC classes that clear your GE requirements). 

I mostly do stuff in an [organization](https://github.com/laurelin60/) I made with some friends.

#### OREOS TIER LIST 

1.) double stuf 
2.) og
3.) peanut butter
4.) mega stuf
5.) mint (tastes kinda like toothpaste, edible tho)
